Example how to make dynamic movement of molecule points using Core Animation and layers

Clone or Download a Demo project. If you want to add that loader to your own project - copy and paste files from "Loader" folder.

### Usage

<img width="800" src="/ReadmeSources/1.png" />

Pass to Loader:
* view - your scene view where you want to see a molecule
* initialPoints (Optional) - by default the Loader will use 4 points to build a molecula
* timeInterval (Optional) - Loader will stop animation and remove itself after this interval
* completion (Optional) - will be called after animation ends

``` swift

	class func show(in view: UIView,
					initialPoints: [CGPoint]? = nil, 
					timeInterval: CFTimeInterval? = nil,  
					withCompletionBlock completion: @escaping (Loader) -> Void)
```
